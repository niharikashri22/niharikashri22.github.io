### Search for MeV Gamma-Ray Emission from TeV-Bright Red Dwarfs with COMPTEL
**Summer Research Project** | May 2024 – July 2024  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Shantanu Desai, Professor, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad

#### Overview
Conducted the first systematic search for soft gamma-ray emission (0.75–30 MeV) from eight TeV-bright red dwarfs previously detected by the SHALON atmospheric Cherenkov telescope. This work investigates whether these red dwarfs could be sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays by searching for multi-wavelength gamma-ray signatures.

#### Scientific Context
The SHALON telescope detected very high energy (TeV) gamma-ray emission from eight red dwarfs: V388 Cas, V547 Cas, V780 Tau, V962 Tau, V1589 Cyg, GJ 1078, GJ 3684, and GL 851.1. These detections are controversial and surprising, as red dwarfs are not typically considered high-energy sources. If confirmed, they would represent a new class of cosmic-ray accelerators.

#### Research Objectives
- Search for MeV gamma-ray counterparts to TeV emission
- Constrain the spectral energy distribution across energy bands
- Test whether red dwarfs can accelerate cosmic rays to ultra-high energies
- Establish upper limits on soft gamma-ray flux for future observations

#### Methodology

1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Processed nine years of archival data from COMPTEL (Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory)
   - Accessed data from HEASARC (High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center)
   - Applied standard COMPTEL data reduction pipeline

2. **Signal Detection:**
   - Computed Test Statistic (TS) at each red dwarf coordinate
   - Generated TS maps within 30° radius to assess background
   - Evaluated statistical significance of potential detections
   - Applied rigorous background modeling

3. **Contamination Analysis:**
   - Identified nearby bright sources (Crab Nebula, Cygnus region)
   - Assessed contamination from sources within COMPTEL's angular resolution
   - Determined that apparent signals were due to nearby sources

4. **Spectral Analysis:**
   - Analyzed Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) in 16 logarithmically-spaced energy bins
   - Computed differential photon flux at 30 MeV
   - Calculated integral photon flux (0.75–30 MeV)
   - Derived integral energy flux

5. **Upper Limits:**
   - Established 95% confidence level upper limits for all eight red dwarfs
   - Reported limits on differential flux, integral photon flux, and energy flux
   - Provided constraints for future multi-wavelength studies

#### Key Results
- **No significant detections:** No statistically significant signal (> 3σ) detected from any red dwarf
- **Contamination identified:** Apparent signals attributed to Crab and Cygnus sources
- **Upper limits established:** Comprehensive 95% C.L. upper limits provided for all targets
- **Future directions:** Results constrain models of particle acceleration in red dwarfs

#### Impact
This work provides the first comprehensive constraints on MeV emission from TeV-bright red dwarfs, complementing previous GeV searches with Fermi-LAT. The results are crucial for understanding whether these controversial TeV detections represent genuine astrophysical phenomena.

#### Technical Skills
- High-energy astrophysics data analysis
- Gamma-ray telescope calibration and systematics
