I am a Physics major in the final year of my BS-MS at IISER Bhopal, where my research has grown at the intersection of astrophysics and particle physics. From probing dark matter candidates in triplet extensions of the Standard Model to modeling galaxy rotation curves from the MAGPI survey and leading a published search for MeV gamma rays from red dwarfs, I have developed a strong passion for understanding the Universe through both theoretical and data-intensive methods.

As I now look toward pursuing a PhD in astronomy, astroparticle physics, or cosmology, I am eager to join a dynamic research environment that values curiosity, rigor, and innovation.

Outside academics, I’ve enjoyed contributing to the IISER Astronomy Club as a coordinator, organizing events, mentoring juniors, and engaging in public outreach—experiences that have shaped me into a collaborative and enthusiastic young researcher. In my free time, I enjoy cycling, dancing and reading.
