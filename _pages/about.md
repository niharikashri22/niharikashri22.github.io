## Physics Researcher | Cosmology & Astroparticle Physics

I'm a final-year BS-MS student in Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, working at the intersection of cosmology, high-energy astrophysics, and particle physics.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on understanding the fundamental nature of the Universe through complementary approaches:

- **Dark matter phenomenology** and its observational signatures
- **High-energy astrophysics**, particularly gamma-ray emission from exotic sources
- **Cosmological probes** of large-scale structure and galaxy evolution
- **Beyond Standard Model physics** and its implications for cosmology

### Current Work

I'm currently completing my master's thesis on dark matter and collider phenomenology in triplet extensions of the Standard Model under the supervision of Dr. Rahul Srivastava. My work explores viable dark matter candidates through relic density calculations, detection prospects, and collider signatures.

### Recent Highlights

**Published Research:** My first-author paper in the *Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics* (2024) reported the first systematic search for MeV gamma-ray emission from TeV-bright red dwarfs using COMPTEL data—establishing stringent upper limits on soft gamma-ray flux from these enigmatic sources.

**Ongoing Projects:** I'm collaborating with researchers at the Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg on modeling dark matter distributions in high-redshift galaxies using MAGPI survey data, investigating the evolution of dark matter halo properties across cosmic time.

### What Drives Me

The questions that motivate my work are fundamental: What is the Universe made of? How did it evolve to its current state? What physics lies beyond the Standard Model? I pursue these questions through data-driven astrophysics, theoretical modeling, and computational analysis—always seeking to bridge observations with fundamental theory.

### Looking Ahead

I'm currently applying to PhD programs in physics, seeking to continue my research in cosmology and astroparticle physics. My goal is to contribute to our understanding of the Universe through rigorous scientific inquiry at the frontier of observational and theoretical physics.
